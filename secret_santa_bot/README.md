## Setting Up Your Own Bot

1. Create a new Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a bot for your application
3. Enable necessary intents (Message Content, Server Members)
4. Copy your bot token and add it to the `.env` file
5. Invite the bot to your server using the OAuth2 URL generator:
   - Required permissions: Send Messages, Read Messages/View Channels
   - Required scopes: bot, applications.commands

## Event Flow
1. Admin creates event with `s!create`
2. Participants join with `s!join`
3. Participants set wishlist and address
4. Admin starts event with `s!start`
5. Bot DMs everyone their Secret Santa assignment
6. Participants can message anonymously using `s!message`

## Notes
- Only one Secret Santa event can be active at a time
- Both wishlist and address are required before the event can start
- Server admins and the event creator can manage the event
- All participant information is cleared when an event is cancelled

## Troubleshooting
- If the bot doesn't respond, check if it has proper permissions
- If commands fail, ensure all required information is provided
- For DM issues, make sure your Discord privacy settings allow DMs from server members
